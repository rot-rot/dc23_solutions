For reasons that are still not clear, we decided to encrypt this flag using a
scheme we call "Double Blowfish 32." A 64-bit key is split in to two 32-bit
keys, and each 64-bit block is encrypted twice -- once with the first 32-bit
key, and again with the second 32-bit key. The most-significant 8 bits of each
key are set to zero for export compliance. The total effective key size is 48
bits.

We use CBC mode because we're not total amateurs, and the IV is the first eight
bytes in the file.

However, in the last minute rush preparing for DEFCON, we lost the key,
potentially ruining the whole challenge. Can you help us recover it?
